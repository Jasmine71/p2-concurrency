# Concurrency

This project has two experiments. 

For each experiment, clone the whole repository first. Then follow the demo description, tinker with the given benchmark program, and reproduce the demo results. Then, do the exercises and submit your answers. 

## Prerequisite (optional)

If you are doing this on your own Linux box (assuming Ubuntu/Debian): 
```
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install cmake gcc gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu 
```

## How to build the experiments
