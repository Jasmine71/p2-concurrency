Races and Synchronization
======================================

Objectives:
-------------

We will tinker with a multithreaded application (using pthreads) that performs parallel updates to a shared counter .

*   primary: demonstrate the ability to recognize critical sections and address them with a variety of different mechanisms.
*   primary: demonstrate the existence of race conditions, and efficacy of the subsequent solutions
*   primary: experience with basic performance instrumentation, measurement and analysis

Viewed from a skills (rather than problem domain) perspective, this project focuses **less on programming**, and more **on performance measurement and analysis**.

Scalability will be addressed in subsequent experiments. 

RELATION TO READING AND LECTURES:
---------------------------------
The basic shared counter problem was introduced in section 28.1.  
Mutexes, test-and-set, spin-locks, and compare-and-swap were described in (many sections of) chapter 28. 
Synchronization of partitioned lists was introduced in section 29.2.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
--------------------

### STUDY

To perform this assignment, you may need to study a few things:

* a more complete tutorial on [pthreads](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads).

* [clock\_gettime(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clock_gettime.2.html) ... high resolution timers (for accurate performance data collection).

* [GCC atomic builtins](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/_005f_005fatomic-Builtins.html) ... functions to directly execute atomic read-modify-write operations.

### Benchmark: a shared integer counter

Our benchmark is a minimalist program -- multiple threads updating a shared integer counter in parallel. 

The program defines a global variable: 

```
long the_counter = 0;
```

The main function spawns *N* worker threads and then waits for them to join: 

```c
pthread_t threads[numThreads];

	for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
		if (pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL,
				(void*) &thread_func, &iterations) < 0) {
					perror("thread_create:");
					exit(1);
		}
	}

	for (int i = 0; i < numThreads; i++) {
		if (pthread_join(threads[i], NULL) < 0) {
				perror("thread_join");
				exit(1);
		}
	}
```

Each thread runs the following function to flip the shared counter repeatedly: 

```
void thread_func(int *iterations) {
	for (int i = 0; i < *iterations; i++)
		add(&the_counter, 1);

	for (int i = 0; i < *iterations; i++)
		add(&the_counter, -1);
}
```

The function `add` updates the counter value by adding to it: 


```
void add(long long *pointer, long long value) {
    long long sum = *pointer + value;
    *pointer = sum;
} 
```

Note that `value` is signed; it can be either positive or negative. 

### Observation

What should be the final counter value after all worker threads are done? Should it be zero -- as the counter is incremented & decremented the same number of times. 

The problem is race condition: multiple worker threads update the counter without exclusion. 

### Update w/o locking

We may see `count==0` with a few threads and fewer iterations (i.e. no conflicting); however, with more threads/iterations we will soon see a non-zero `count`. 

```
%./lab2_add-nolock --iterations=100 --threads=10
test=add-none threadNum=10 iterations=100 numOperation=2000 runTime(ns)=634688 avgTime(ns)=317 count=0

% ./lab2_add-nolock --iterations=10000 --threads=10
test=add-none threadNum=10 iterations=10000 numOperation=200000 runTime(ns)=5280826 avgTime(ns)=26 count=-5275
```

> Why does it take many iterations before errors are seen?  Why does a significantly smaller number of iterations so seldom fail?  

### Update with locking

One way to fix conflicting updates is to wrap around `add()` with locking: 

```
// create a global mutex
pthread_mutex_t mutex;
pthread_mutex_init(&mutex, NULL)

// in each worker thread
pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
add(&the_counter, val);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
```

With synchronized updates, we will always see the right count value: 

```
$ ./lab2_add --iterations=100000 --threads=10 --sync=m
test=add-m threadNum=10 iterations=100000 numOperation=2000000 runTime(ns)=147502381 avgTime(ns)=73 count=0
```

## Conclusion

We have seen the necessity of synchronization and understood the basic structure of the benchmark. Play with the given benchmark and reproduce the results above. After that, proceed to the assignments.
